## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
dados = read_csv(here("data/series_from_imdb.csv"), 
                    progress = FALSE,
                    col_types = cols(.default = col_double(), 
                                     series_name = col_character(), 
                                     episode = col_character(), 
                                     url = col_character(),
                                     season = col_character())) %>% filter(series_name %in% c("Sherlock", "Elementary"))
series = unique(subset(dados, select=c("series_name")))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
estatisticas <- dados %>% 
  group_by(series_name) %>%
  summarise(mediana = median(user_rating), media = mean(user_rating), maximo = max(user_rating), minimo = min(user_rating))


```

```{r}
dados %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season_ep, y = user_rating, color = season)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(series_name ~ .)
```

```{r}
dados %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = user_rating)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, fill = "pink", color = "black") + 
    geom_rug(alpha = .5, size = 1.5) +
    facet_grid(season ~ series_name)
```

```{r}

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
